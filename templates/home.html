  <div class="div_page_title"><p>My name is Mia Campdera-Pulido and I'm seventeen years old. Currently I am cursing the IB Diploma Program in Barcelona, Spain. Even though this is the city were I've always lived with my family, I was born in California, US and have had an experience abroad. Last year I spend an entire school year in Arizona, US which I consider one of the best life-changing experiences I have ever had. I learned a lot about myself and the American culture between others. That year helped me shape as a person and I now consider myself an independent, open-minded and enthusiastic person. In addition, I am personally interested in painting and sailing since it helps me pay attention to small details and be a focused person. My CAS website portrays the creativity, activity, and service projects I have been involved in. CAS has helped me go out of my comfort zone and discover new passions such as coding and tutoring.</p></div>
